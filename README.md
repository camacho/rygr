Simple scaffolding CLI to setup up a build tool and server to support thick web clients.

Rygr is based on the idea of getting developers writing their web app as fast as possible. It scaffolds a foundational layer that provides a battle-tested stack, and then gets out of the way.

Everything generated by Rygr is customizable to the developer's needs. Towards that end, it utilizes popular open source projects like Bower, Gulp, npm, and Express, to make it easy to add, remove, and change any behavior of the server, build tasks, languages, compilers and dependencies.

Prerequisites
---
Rygr is written in CoffeeScript and generates Node projects that utilize Bower and Gulp.

To install Node via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), run:

```sh
brew update
brew install node
```

Rygr is intended to be run as a global npm:

```shell
npm install -g rygr
```

Init
---
To initialize a new Rygr project, go to the directory and run:

```shell
rygr init
```

Alternatively, you can have Rygr create the directory as part of the scaffolding by including the project name:

```shell
rygr init <name>
```

What's generated?
---
Rygr generates a new project that is supported by npm, Gulp, and Bower.

Front end:
* RequireJS
* CoffeeScript
* SASS w/Bourbon (using LibSass)
* Jade JS templates
* Jade HTML pages
* Static files
* Image optimization
* Bower for 3rd party dependencies

Server:
* Express server with middleware and Jade views

The thick client is supported by a simple Express server. It uses middleware
options to properly load a build of the client and support and push state URLs.
The server can also be extended with additional functionality (like an API) with
no problems.

Build tool
---
Rygr uses Gulp.js as it's build tool.

To build the npm:

```shell
gulp build
```

To build, watch for changes, and develop locally:

```shell
gulp build && npm link && gulp watch
```

Rygr also provides a blank test command via Gulp that is accessible by either 
running `npm test` or `gulp test`.
