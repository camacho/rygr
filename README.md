A foundational build tool and simple server to support thick web clients.

Rygr is built on the idea of having strong opinions that are loosely held. It serves as a foundational layer by providing a developer with a battle-tested stack to help them start coding in minutes.

Everything generated by Rygr is customizable to the developer's needs. Towards that end, it utilizes popular open source projects like Bower, Gulp, NPM, and Express, to make it easy to add, remove, and change any behavior of the server, build tasks, languages, compilers and dependencies.

Prerequisites
---
Rygr is written in CoffeeScript and generates Node projects that utilize Bower and Gulp.

To install Node via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), run:

```sh
brew update
brew install node
```

Rygr is intended to be run as a global npm:

```shell
npm install -g rygr
```

Init
---
To initialize a new Rygr project, go to the directory and run:

```shell
rygr init
```

What's generated?
---
Rygr generates a new project that is supported by npm, Gulp, and Bower.

Front end:
* RequireJS modules (including templates)
* Coffeescript
* SASS w/Bourbon
* HAMLC JS templates
* HAMLC HTML pages
* Static files
* Bower for 3rd party dependencies

Server:
* Express with middleware

The thick client is supported by a simple Express server. It uses middleware
options to properly load a build of the client and support and push state URLs.
The server can also be extended with additional functionality (like an API) with
no problems.

Build tool
---
Rygr uses Gulp.js as it's build tool.

To build the npm:

```shell
gulp build
```

To build, watch for changes, and test locally:

```shell
gulp build && npm link && gulp watch
```
